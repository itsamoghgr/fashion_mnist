#Fashion Mnist Data Classification
----

I have built a simple convoluation neural network (CNN) using tensorflow (TF) to classify Fashion-MNIST dataset. 
https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist --> This Data was extracted from the Zolando's Research. The Data was uploaded directly from the TensorFlow 

The training set consists of 60k examples and test set consists of 10k examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image. The Training/Testing ratio is 8:2.

Classification is done into 8 categories. 

0 T-shirt/top <br>
1 Trouser <br>
2 Pullover <br>
3 Dress <br>
4 Coat <br>
5 Sandal <br>
6 Shirt <br>
7 Sneaker <br>
8 Bag <br>
9 Ankle boot <br>
